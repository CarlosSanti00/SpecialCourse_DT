# Data Directory
Recopilation of the necessary scripts for loading the data. A jupyter notebook is included as an example code on how to load the data. A 'requirements.txt' file is uploaded with the main Python libraries needed for uploading the datasets (additionally libraries may be needed to upload all of the data as shown in the jupyter notebook).

The data repository is uploaded in a separate drive link due to the database size, and it can be found in the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dVQFcr-krOMxBAGnhQ0CzYg48ySGjQHq
