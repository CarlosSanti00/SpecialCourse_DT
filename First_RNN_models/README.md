# First RNN models
First Neural Networks structures created with Keras and TensorFlow Python Libraries. In addition, some hyper-parameter tuning was implemented with some Keras functions. The notebooks included in this folder only reflect an initial try during my project, but any of these are relevant in the context of the results presented in the final report.
