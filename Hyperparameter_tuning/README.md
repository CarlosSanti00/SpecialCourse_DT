# Hyperparameter tuning
In this folder, I included the two types of manual hyperparameter tuning implemented during my special course. One was implemented for an RNN based on 1 hidden layer with 1 hidden unit, and the other one was implemented for checking additional hidden units and other parameters to check the performance of the network by adding more complexity.
